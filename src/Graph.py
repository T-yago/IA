        """
        Finds the shortest path from the start node to the end node using the A* algorithm.

        The A* algorithm is an informed search algorithm that uses heuristics to guide the search
        towards the goal node. It maintains two lists: an open list and a closed list. The open list
        contains the nodes that are yet to be explored, while the closed list contains the nodes that
        have already been explored.

        The algorithm starts by initializing the open list with the start node. It then iteratively
        selects the node with the lowest estimated cost (based on the sum of the actual cost from the
        start node and the heuristic estimate to the goal node) from the open list. If the selected node
        is the goal node, the algorithm reconstructs the path from the start node to the goal node and
        returns it along with the cost of the path.

        However, if the selected node is not the goal node, the algorithm dynamically expands the chosen 
        node's neighborhood, generating adjacent nodes that are directly accessible from the current position. 
        It then calculates or updates various values for each neighboring node, including the actual cost from 
        the start node to the neighbor, the heuristic estimate from that node to the goal, and the sum of these 
        two values (the f-cost).

        Subsequently, the algorithm checks whether each neighboring node is already part of the open list or the 
        closed list. Nodes that are absent from the open list or have a lower f-cost compared to their previous 
        state are considered for inclusion or update. This iterative process ensures that the algorithm continues 
        to prioritize nodes with lower estimated costs, creating an efficient search strategy.

        The A* algorithm repeats the selection step, choosing the next node with the lowest estimated cost from the 
        updated open list. This cycle continues until the goal node is eventually reached or until the open list is 
        empty, signifying that no viable path to the goal exists.

        The A* algorithm is commonly used in pathfinding problems, where finding the shortest path
        between two points in a graph is required.
        
        Parameters:
            start (Node): The starting node.
            end (Node): The target node.

        Returns:
            tuple: A tuple containing the shortest path as a list of nodes and the cost of the path.
